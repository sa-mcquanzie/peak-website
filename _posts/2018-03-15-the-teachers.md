The Teachers​ ​is a collaborative audio-visual presentation by London-based electronic artist, ​Haich​ and Sheffield-based visual artist, ​Ashley Holmes​. The presentation is centred around newly made film, painting and installation works by Holmes, that respond to the recently released EP by Haich, titled Unbalanced.

​A live performance by Haich of his new music will be taking place in the project space at Peak on the evening of the private view.

Taking influences from many different styles of music, Haich re-imagines the conventions from genres spanning as wide as dub, soul, techno and grime and uses them as a conduit to create the theme music to his own perplexingly awkward yet beautiful universe.

Ashley Holmes works individually and collaboratively across video, performance, sculpture and music. He combines an interest in technical processes of moving image and sound, with a critical understanding of the dynamic emotional conditions that can be considered within the context of the term ‘raciology’ - a discourse that assumes certain stereotypes, prejudices, images and identities.
