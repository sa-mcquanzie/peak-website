<p>What does it mean to have so little control over how people see you, and to be so pressed from all sides? What happens when how you present yourself is taken as an invitation to consume you? Flippant consumption of the black male body is rampant; how can making images of the black male body be resistant to that? What does it mean to make work about this as a black man, and who gets to consume it and on what terms?
<br />
Got a screwface all night, all day<br />
Screwface keeps breddas at bay<br />
Screwface means keep well away, stay away<br />
Screwface means get out my way<br />
Screwface means you don't know me<br />
What you looking at, what's your beef?<br />
Screwface means I'm not having it<br />
Screwface means I'm not a chief<br />
Screwface means I'm not happy right now<br />
That's why no smile was used<br />
Screwface means I'm not pleased<br />
Screwface means I'm not amused<br />
Screwface means I just wanna walk not talk<br />
Screwface means I just wanna leave<br />
When I activate my screwface, give me space<br />
Screwface means let me breathe<br />
</p>

<p>Enter the zone where the cycle of objectification and representation is narrowed to a hysterical loop: social war, existential war, inner war, outer war, total war. Take a breath, if you can. </p>
