<p>What does it mean to have so little control over how people see you, and to be so pressed from all sides? What happens when how you present yourself is taken as an invitation to consume you? Flippant consumption of the black male body is rampant; how can making images of the black male body be resistant to that? What does it mean to make work about this as a black man, and who gets to consume it and on what terms?</p>

<p>
Got a screwface all night, all day
Screwface keeps breddas at bay
Screwface means keep well away, stay away
Screwface means get out my way
Screwface means you don't know me
What you looking at, what's your beef?
Screwface means I'm not having it
Screwface means I'm not a chief
Screwface means I'm not happy right now
That's why no smile was used
Screwface means I'm not pleased
Screwface means I'm not amused
Screwface means I just wanna walk not talk
Screwface means I just wanna leave
When I activate my screwface, give me space
Screwface means let me breathe
</p>

<p>Enter the zone where the cycle of objectification and representation is narrowed to a hysterical loop: social war, existential war, inner war, outer war, total war. Take a breath, if you can. </p>
