<p>We warmly invite MCs, producers and DJs who are connected to Elephant & Castle’s astonishing music history to take part in PEAK TIMES, a live documentation project in the Elephant & Castle Shopping Centre’s artist-run @peak_london project space.</p>

<p>On <b>Fri 19 & Sat 20 April 12-7pm</b>, we aim to film, photograph and record as many of the people who have contributed to Elephant’s remarkable club music legacy as we can. From pioneers to unsung heroes, Ministry of Sound to Corsica Studios, big room Techno to basement UKG, Elephant has contributed considerably more to global dance culture than merely the myth of Aphex Twin living inside the Faraday Memorial. Whilst the area has managed to withstand some of the rampant redevelopment experienced in other parts of London, the Shopping Centre’s impending closure gives rise to a moment of reflection.</p>

<p>MCs, Producers and DJs of any club genre either from, or who have performed in and around, Elephant, are warmly invited. Photography, filming and some audio recording will take place. We encourage you to bring relevant club flyers or any other important portable memorabilia.</p>
