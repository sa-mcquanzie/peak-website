**DEATH LOLZ PRESENTS...**

**TUESDAY 5th JUNE 2018**

**TALKS** with **Oliver Corino** and **Angharad Williams**

**Doors open at 7.30pm, First talk at 8.00**

There will be an interval, and a bar serving drinks throughout the evening.

In his talk Favourite Son, Oliver Corino will read three short pieces about gifts his family have given him, before reading a fragment from Canary Wharf’s new memoir from the latest series of Architectural Fathers by Canary Wharf that he publishes under OCR. The crossover between his own domestic situation and Canary Wharf’s he hopes, will enable an approach to some of the wide ranging effects, psychological and other, that Canary Wharf’s residential district may have as it gifts 3000 new homes to London.
