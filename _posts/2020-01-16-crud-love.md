Over the last year Adam Lewis Jacob has worked closely with the Trade Union Resource Centre (TURC) moving image archive, where he came across animations made in the mid 80’s by the political cartoonist Steve Bell, which form the basis for the central video work in this exhibition. 


Interventions occur throughout the space. Outside, the gallery sign has been programmed to turn on and off, translating a conversation between Adam and his nan into Morse code. They talk about a shopping centre visited weekly throughout his childhood, which is also facing the negative impacts of regeneration experienced by many of the people that use and work in Elephant & Castle Shopping Centre.


Objects from the Peak office have been selected by people connected to the space and moved by Adam into the main room. Taken together, the animation, conversation, and objects in and outside of the room, talk about feelings of collective trauma, anxiety, boredom and frustration.


Adam Lewis Jacob uses animation, video and objects to observe the dominant culture that surrounds him
and its impact on individual and collective identities. His works are invested in establishing collaborative dialogues over singular authorship and use conversation as a material to form ideas and make work.
