> From 21/06/18 - 01/07/18 **The Café** are taking over Peak
>
> **SURPLUS**​ brings together artists May Hands and Sean Roy Parker in a collaborative exploration of natural and synthetic detritus. The exhibition has been conceived as a living installation where the gallery will function as a site of reflection, development and engagement on issues of sustainable practice, responding to the local Elephant & Castle environment and its residents. ​SURPLUS​ will also constitute the inaugural exhibition of new itinerant gallery The Café who will be hosted by Peak in recognition of the increasingly precarious gallery landscape in London.
>
> Using both traditional and non-traditional techniques, Hands and Parker process and respond to the catastrophic human impact on the environment and urge us to reflect upon the normalisation of over-consumption and waste. Through their work, surfeit is held to account; use is replaced by reuse, gratuitousness challenged by merit, and depletion is met by renewal. The exhibition will pivot around a series of workshops and events during which visitors will be invited to join Hands and Parker in creative processes using collected and foraged leftovers from commercial production and natural environmental cycles, together with discarded materials encountered through their daily routines.
>
> The space will be open throughout the period of exhibition installation while the artists construct and visitors are welcome to drop by during this time.  
>
> Private View: Thursday 21st June, 7pm
>
> Tickets for events available via Eventbrite
